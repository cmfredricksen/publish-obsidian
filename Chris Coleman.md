### Crime Details:
**Date:** May 5, 2009
**Location:** The Family's Home in Columbia IL

**Arrested:** May 19, 2009
**Convicted:** May 5, 2011
Chris got out on bail and lived with his parents while awaiting his trial.

He sent threatening emails to himself, and to his boss Joyce Meyer and her son. The emails threatened to kill Chris's family if he did not stop Joyce Meyer from preaching the gospel.

Date of threatening emails: [[2008-11-14]] was the first email.
Date he says Tara changed his life: [[2008-11-05]]
**SIX DAYS LATER**

He told his wife he wanted a divorce and that she and the children were ruining his life.

Sherri told a friend that if she died Chris killed her.

The day of the murders Chris called in sick to work for the first time ever.

Chris went to the gym in the early morning hours of May 5, [**5:43am**][2] and then called his neighbor [**Justin Barlow**][3] who lived across the street to go check on his family. **The gym was 5 minutes from his home.** He said that he had been calling and getting no response and that his family was normally up and getting ready for the day by that time. *_Chris had never called called or texted Sheri in the morning before this date._* He returned home at [**6:56am**].

Many windows of the house were unlocked the morning of the murder. The window that the detective Justin and his colleague entered the house through was unlocked and the screen was removed. [basement window] 

His neighbor called the police for backup and waited for them to arrive. They found the bodies of the family [Justin][3] called Chris and he came home. He didn't react very strongly to finding out his family was dead. He had scratches on his arms, when the police asked him how he got scratches on his arm(s), he punched the gurney he was on and said he got the scratches from the gurney.

Findings in the Coleman home by his neighbor:
Graffiti on the walls in red, 
The spray paint was bought on [Feb 8 2009] by Chris. 
His son Gavin dead in bed with the words "Fuck You" spray painted over the blankets.
Wife found dead in the master bedroom, she had a black eye and multiple ligature marks on her neck.

Chris never asked how his family died and never tried to go in to see his family.

Chris denied his affair with [Tara Lintz][1], and she confirmed it.

The threatening emails were sent from Chris's computer and he claimed someone hacked him.

The police seized Chris's 2 laptops and his phone when he was arrested.
[[Chris's Laptop]] - explicit pictures [naked photos and gifs of Chris masturbating] and films of him and Tara. His file on her included:
things she liked, her account names and passwords, name of their future daughter(s). It listed the birthdate of Tara's dog.
The email account was created on Chris's computer and the emails originated from it.
[[Chris's Phone]]

He messaged Tara from the funeral for his family saying he missed her(Tara).

### Background
**Perp(s):**
Age: March 20 1977 **32** at time of crime

Son of 2 pastors at a non-denominational church. _This could be part of his hatred toward [[Joyce Meyer]], he has been behind the scenes of religious grift his entire life. I wonder if his parents work had anything to do with him being the head of security at Joyce Meyer's ministry - making [$100,000 per year in 2008][4]. He had no college, but served in the military. He was a dog handler for the canine police. _
_Chris and his brothers would often speak in tongues during services. Chris based most of his decisions on the bible._

Chris' father [Ron Coleman] claimed the spray paint was bought so they could paint a bullseye on **[]**  Chris's father said that Tara was just meeting a need for their son that Sherri didn't. Both of his parents justified his affair in spite of being pastors. He said if your wife doesn't respect you, you're going to find respect somewhere else. He claims that Chris did not buy the promise ring for Tara and that he was trying to get away from Tara at the time of the killing.
Chris's parents did not like Sheri and blamed her for ruining Chris's life.

*_There is a compromising picture of Tara on Chris's dad's computer!!!ðŸ”¥_*

[Connie Coleman] She did not like Sheri.  She seems detached about the killings in interview with [[Crime watch daily]]. She claims she didn't know there were problems in Chris's marriage.  She says that she believes her son is innocent until she sees proof otherwise. I think she is LYING. _do people, like the community and the constituents, believe her over the police detectives, forensic experts, prosecutor, judge, and jury? Is she lying because she knows her followers will believe her and continue to give her money?_

Chris spray painted messages on the walls of the house and over his dead family in their beds using red spray paint.

House was on a lake. Quiet community.

He claimed that he paused while backing out of his driveway that morning because of a "dark" car driving by, but the film footage shows him driving forward from the driveway, no passing car.

_He was employed for 11 years by Joyce Meyer when the crime had happened. So he was working for her from the time he was 20 years old! Joyce Meyer had met Chris when he was a child because his mother would take him to workshops at Joyce's ministry or church. **How much money did Chris' mom Connie give to the Joyce Meyer ministry?[[Church Money Web]]** Chris started out in general security and then became a supervisor. At some point **[when]** someone quit from Joyce's personal security team and they offered the job to Chris. In this role Chris traveled with Joyce whenever she worked out of town and out of country. This should have been his dream job, paid lots of money to travel in high class on top of that.  _

Sherri confided in Joyce's **[Daniel]** about his marital difficulties [2008]. The son told Joyce so she could talk to Chris.  Chris told Joyce that Sherri was very controlling and that no matter what he did she wasn't happy. That in general they just didn't get along and that he was tired of it. Joyce offered him marriage counseling with a pastor at their church and Chris agreed, so they started going to counseling. [Fall 2008] _before Chris acknowledges having his affair._

In his police interview he says that the counseling was working and that everything was great in their relationship. *_How did nobody see the blaring red signs when Chris started getting emails threatening his family because they were mad at Joyce?_* Considering that things were NOT fine, according to [Sherry[[5]] plus these letters when he had told Joyce that he was tired of the relationship and described her as controlling and a nag. Like, not even an eyebrow raised? **Hard to believe**

He told Joyce that he had started receiving these emails [[Late March 2009 - April 2009]] and then that the person had started leaving messages in her mailbox. *_What part of these tactics has to do with his line of work in security?_* Chris claimed that he had reported it to the police and that he has a detective living across the street. He said that they were going to put a camera on the mailbox to see if they could catch the person doing this. _Nobody else who worked for Joyce had ever received a death threat before. Even the one other person doing the same job as he was!_

The emails came from an address **destroychris@gmail.com**. On [February 27, 2009] he received a letter in his mailbox at his home from the same person threatening.

*_Joyce was NOT told of these threats until  at least 4 months has passed!!_*

He met his wife while he was in the military, she was in the Air Force. Date Met:**[]**
Date Married: **[]** Chris and Sherri got married suddenly and without any family or wedding, implication being they married due to pregnancy. _His mom Connie said she was not impressed with Sherri when they first met. Sherri was raised Catholic, which bothered his parents._

Joined the marines, was a guard

Work: Head of security [[Joyce Meyer]] Ministries, making $100K a year plus benefits. He thought Joyce Meyer was a fraud, taking money from people so she could fly on a private jet. ðŸ”–He felt that what she was preaching was nonsense.

Having an affair with a woman named [Tara Lintz][1], starting Nov 2008. That is when he started sending threatening letters to himself. October 2008, relationship was already happening. In the fall of 2008, shortly after getting his promotion, he became cocky and arrogant and shaved his head because he said it made him look tougher.


**Victim(s):**
His wife of ** Years, his two elementary aged sons.

He met his wife while in the military, she was also in the military. They dated for 3 months before getting married. His parents blamed Sheri for this, thought that she entrapped Chris.

### Resolution

Charged with three counts of first degree murder for strangling his wife and children to death.

After he killed them he sprayed graffiti  on the inside of the house.

He tried to blame his job for the threats, that he and his family were being targeted because of his job. After that he blamed his job as in that he was afraid he would be fired from his job if he got divorced.

Sentenced to three life sentences. Still claiming his innocence. His family believes him.

In prison in Wisconsin

He is attempting to get a new trial **[date]**.

### Fallout

Brad Coleman, Chris's younger brother and a prison guard, said his mental health has suffered after his brother's conviction and requested a declaration of incapacity in 2014.

There are people who write to Chris in prison asking him for spiritual advice. [**Need Source**] _Why? 1. Maybe because his father is a minister or 2.Becaue he worked for [[Joyce Meyer]]._

#### More info:
[1]:(Tara Lintz was the former best friend from High School of victim Sherri, she lived in Florida. Sherri believed that Tara was jealous of her.) Chris kept a log of her including: Her panty size, her bra size, her physical features, the name of their future daughter, and the date she changed his life, her ring size and stuff about her _bleep_. **November 5, 2008** _Exactly 6 months before the murder!_ Three days after she changed his life, the threatening emails started coming. After high school, Sherri left [Largo Florida to attend the Air Force. Tara became an exotic dancer.] ðŸ”¥She then became a cocktail waitress at the Greyhound Derby track. Tara insisted he divorce Sherri, he told he would, in the beginning of May 2009. Tara continued communicating with Chris after the murders, and when she was forced to testify by the courts she was still wearing the promise ring he has given her.)

[2]:(His neighbor from across the street had a video camera fixed on Chris's house due to the threats Chris had been receiving, and the video shows that Chris left at 5:43 am and not before. This is important because [[Baden]] said the family was definitely dead before 5am and probably before 3am. Once the cameras were put up, only known to Chris and his neighbor, the messages stopped arriving in his mailbox. )

[3]:(His neighbor was a police officer, a police sg)

[4]:(That wage was nearly double the average salary in that area from 2009)

[5]:(Sherry cried to a friend that Chris wanted a divorce and told her he didn't love her. she said he would put on a nice face for the counselor, but once they got home he would start treating her like shit again. In early [Jan 2009], they had sex according to her neighbor and friend, which was a very unusual occurrence. Afterward he told Sherri not to think that meant he loved her. **He wanted a divorce, but did not want to initiate it!** This is because divorce is frowned upon in Christian families and the Churches. He started acting awful toward Sherri to get her to initiate the divorce because he didn't want to lose his job.)
[6]: In the first deliberations of the jury, it leaned in Chris's favor 7 to five! However, later on jurors were swayed by the lies he told police.
