Tidbits:
Both killers took sexually suggestive photos of their lovers in the bathroom, among other places. Sex with their mistress was an important part of their motivation. **Did having control over a woman, someone who submitted to them give them a sense of being a man, which overtook their lives**

Both families appeared to be the ideal family to outward appearances.

Both were unconvincing after the crime. _To me they both seem to lack any concern for what happened to their family, and to me it seems like they really didn't care about their family at all. No remorse! Which to me means that they are psychopaths and would not hesitate to do the same this again._

Both were Entitled.

Neither man fit the profile of a killer.
