## Chris Watts
#family-annihilator  #multiple-murderer #familicide #30s #CO
[[Familicide]]


### Crime Details:

**Date:** August 13, 2018
**Location:** Frederick CO

Shannan was staying with family in *NC* for 6 weeks before the killings. 

She arrived home at 2:30am, and Chris tells her he is leaving her for another woman. Then he smothers his wife to death, witnessed by one of his children. His daughter begged for her life, but he killed her anyway.

He wrapped Shannan in a sheet and put her body on the floor of the backseat of his truck. Then he loaded the girls into their car seats, with their mom’s body right below their feet. It was a 45 minute drive in the middle of the night. 

The day after the murders Chris contacted (Before they were even reported missing!):
The girls school to tell them they would not be returning
A realtor to put the house up for sale

### Background:

#### Perp:
Age: May 16, 1985 **33** at time of crime

He was having an affair with [[Nicole Kessinger]], whom he had met at work.

Nicole is a narcissist. She denies any culpability in the murders. But she did know.

Since going to prison he claims to have found God and is now a Christian. He says he murdered his family because he was over taken by a dark force.

[[New Breed of Psychopath]]:  He can mask his emotions well, only seen before in [[Ted Bundy]]. 

[[Killer of Convenience]] rather than a family-annihilator. The family annihilator normally takes himself out too, he is looking to eradicate the whole family in rage.

A killer of convenience is only in it for themselves, what is most convenient to them. So Chris killing his family was getting them out of the way of having what he wanted. They hadn’t done anything, even in his own mind to warrant being killed. They were simply disposable, and he didn’t want to play with them anymore.




#### Victim(s):
Chris murdered his **pregnant** wife by strangulation and then smothered his daughters with a blanket.

He then disposed of their bodies at an oil field, putting the girls into a well and burying his wife in a shallow grave.

### Victims:

Wife:
Shannan Watts nee Russo
Age: January 10, 1984 **32** at time of crime
Daughter: Bella
Age: 4
Daughter: Celeste
Age: 3
Son: Nico
Age: not born yet _Shannan was 15 weeks pregnant_

Shannan Watts friend [[Nickole Atkinson]] got things rolling right away.



### Resolution:
Sentenced to five life sentences with no chance of parole, three to be served consecutively.

### Fallout

### My Thoughts
If Chris actually cared about Shannan he would have realized that she would be missed immediately. He actually thought he would get away with it. 

He said “Being a woman…” like the fact that her being a woman meant she suspected something that wasn’t true. When in fact she was correct. She should have suspected more, it could have saved their lives.

He is one buttoned down mother fucker. He seems like he is holding back, even before the killings.

I wonder what life was really like in that household. Shannan believed her husband was a good man. Nobody ever expects their spouse to kill them.

He actually believed he could just claim she disappeared and move on with his new life. This is the part that puzzles me the most. I mean that morning he had already called the girls’ school and withdrew them. He also called a realtor to sell his house. He texted with his girlfriend about their future.

How must he have been feeling that morning before he got the calls looking for Shannan. He must have been euphoric. He was free, what a huge accomplishment, getting rid of his family who was holding him back. He didn’t care. He simply DID NOT CARE that he had snuffed them out and desecrated their bodies. He didn’t worry about what that said about him.

When they are searching the house, Chris is interviewed on the front porch, and it is obvious the tension he feels, that he is pushing down.

His mother is despicable, saying she forgives him at his trial. That should have been kept in private, especially in the presence of Shannan’s family.
